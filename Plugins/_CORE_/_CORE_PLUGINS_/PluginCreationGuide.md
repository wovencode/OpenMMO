# PLUGIN CREATION GUIDE

Creating new Plugins may be an overwhelming task at first glance. 
But the process can be simplified by copying and renaming the Example Plugin Folder.
It should be fairly straight-forward if you are familiar with the concept of Network Messages.
(NOTE: You will also need to rename any classes and script references in the copied folder that are causing conflicts).

The best when starting from a limited knowledge base is to begin with the Connection System, as it only handles one type of Message. 
As you become more familiar with how message handling works, move on to the Account System or Player System for more complex examples.
