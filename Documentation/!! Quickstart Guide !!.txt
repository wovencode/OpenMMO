BUILDING OPENMMO GUIDE:

STEP 1 - SET UP YOUR PROJECT
1 - Start a new project in Unity 2019 (any version of 2019 will work)
2 - Open the Window>TextMeshPro>Import TextMeshPro Essentials Menu to import TextMeshPro into your project
3 - Download the entire git repo and put it into Assets/OpenMMO inside your project folder. (Naming it OpenMMO in the Assets folder is very important)


STEP 2 - ADD YOUR GAME SCENES TO THE BUILD LIST
1 - In Unity, Open Build Settings from the File Menu, move the window to the side so you can drag scenes to it from your project view.
2 - Inside your Project View, Scroll down to the Scenes folder
3 - Drag UI Scene, Login Scene, and any other scenes from the Scenes folder into the "Scenes to Build" section of the Build Window you left opened.
3 - Make sure that the Login Scene is at the top and the UI Scene is at the bottom of the "Scenes to Build" box.
4 - Close the Build Settings window.


STEP 3 - OPEN THE LOGIN SCENE
1 - Open the Login Scene in the Unity Editor.


STEP 4 - BUILD YOUR GAME
1 - Click the OpenMMO menu at the top of the editor, then click QuickBuild/<YourOS>/Client and Server (headless)
2 - Just wait... it is doing things in the background...you will see a [Build Report] in the editor console when it finishes (you can click that to see the whole report)


STEP 5 - LAUNCH YOUR SERVER
1 - In File Explorer, Navigate to your project folder and look for the _BUILD folder there.
2 - Launch the server.exe (or .x86_64 or .app on non Windows) you find there. The server should launch one main process and an additional process for each zone.
	Using the default setup, you should expect 4 processes to open in total.


STEP 6 - LAUNCH A CLIENT
1 - Go back to the _BUILD directory and find the client.exe (or .x86_64 or .app on non Windows) file and launch that to start testing.
