# PLUGIN CREATION GUIDE

Creating new Plugins may be an overwhelming task at first glance, but by copying and renaming one of the existing Plugin Folders (NOTE: You will also need to rename any classes in the copied folder that are causing conflicts). It should be fairly straight-forward if you are familiar with the concept of Network Messages.

The best when starting from a limited knowledge base is to begin with the Connection System, as it only handles one type of Message then move on to the Player System and finally the Account System.
